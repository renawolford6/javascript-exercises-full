The goal of this exercise is to introduce you to the concept of objects and classes. These are fundamental building blocks for OOP (Object Oriented Programming). You shouldn't need to write a ton of new code, in fact you can re-use your solution from the Simon Says exercise!

The key here will be rewriting certain bits of it to work within the class given to you.
